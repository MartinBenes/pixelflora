# Code of Conduct

## Our commitment

We are committed to creating a respectful, harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of background or identity.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful, constructive, and professional.
- Assume good intent and focus on technical facts.
- Accept feedback gracefully.
- Prioritize the health of the community over ego.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Trolling, baiting, or intentionally disruptive behavior.
- Publishing private information without consent.
- Repeatedly derailing technical discussions.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct. Repeated or severe violations may lead to temporary or permanent bans.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact project maintainers privately with relevant context and evidence.

This policy is inspired by the Contributor Covenant spirit and adapted for this project.
